#Broken Link Checker

This NextJS app takes a link and checks if it is working. It also fetches the sublinks on the page of the given link, to tell if they are working or not. 

#Hosted Link

#Issues

I have opted for a very basic design due to time constraints. You may DM me with suggestions on what and how to improve the app.
